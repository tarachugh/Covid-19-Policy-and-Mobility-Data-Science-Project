# Covid-19-Policy-and-Mobility-Data-Science-Project

Used Google's Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports and Oxford BSG's Coronavirus Policy Data to create 5d visuals of U.S. Covid-19 policy and mobility trends. Also created a neural network to predict mobility trends from policy data with only 3.1% error. 


Machine Learning models and algorithms implemented:
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis
- Long Short-Term Memory Network (Recurrent Neural Network)
